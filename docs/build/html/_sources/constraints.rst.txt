Constraints
===========
    For scientific and analyze uses, this application is orientated to various 
    users(biologists) all over the world. Before developing the project, we have 
    to take some main constraints into account so that we can come up any useful ideas
    to deal with them in the future. 

Browser Compatibility
---------------------
    Since the application is designed for a wildly used application, 
    it should have a cross platform compatibility to satisfy various users.
    Thus the application should be **accessible through Firefox, Chrome, and Safari**. 


Space Complexity
----------------
    Not only the time complexity should be considered, but also the space complexity.
    There are two aspects for space complexity. One is the size of the whole web 
    application. **The application should not larger than 1GB.** For another aspect, when 
    the application starts data analyzing, memory occupancy must be limited under a 
    certain level to make sure the system work in a proper way. 


Budget
------
    Budget less than 10,000 USD(To Be Specified). 

System Downtime
---------------
    System **downtime less than 30 minutes per year** in order to satisfy users'
    large demand of data analyzing.
